# ✅ DNS CONFIGURATION CORRECT - Propagation in Progress

## 🎉 **UPDATE: DNS Setup is Perfect!**

Your Porkbun DNS configuration is **correctly set up**:

```
✅ CORRECT SETUP:
A Record: theporadas.com → 76.76.19.19
CNAME: www.theporadas.com → cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**Status:** Waiting for DNS propagation (normal process)

---

## 🕐 **Current Situation: DNS Propagation Delay**

### **What's Happening:**

- ✅ Your DNS records are correctly configured in Porkbun
- ✅ Vercel is receiving requests (`Server: Vercel` in curl response)
- 🟡 Global DNS propagation is still in progress
- � Local ISP/computer still serving old cached records

### **No Action Required - Just Wait!**

Your DNS is correctly configured. The process now is:

1. **✅ DONE:** DNS records correctly set in Porkbun
2. **🟡 IN PROGRESS:** Global DNS propagation (15 minutes - 24 hours)
3. **⏳ WAITING:** Your ISP and local DNS to update their cache

### **How to Monitor Progress:**

1. Go to [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com)
2. Sign in → Account → Domain Management
3. Find `theporadas.com` → Click "Details" → Click "DNS" tab

### **Step 2: Remove Old DNS Records**

**❌ DELETE these records if they exist:**

- Any A record for `www` host
- Any A record pointing to `216.198.79.1` or `64.29.17.1`
- Any CNAME for `www` pointing to old hosting providers
- Any parking page redirects

### **Step 3: Add Correct Vercel DNS Records**

#### **Record 1: WWW CNAME (CRITICAL)**

```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Answer: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 300 (low for faster propagation)
```

#### **Record 2: Root Domain A Record**

```
Type: A
Host: @ (or blank)
Answer: 76.76.19.19
TTL: 300
```

### **Step 4: Save and Wait**

1. **Save changes** in Porkbun
2. **Wait 15-30 minutes** for propagation
3. **Test with:** `nslookup www.theporadas.com`

## ✅ **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Correct DNS Resolution:**

```powershell
# What you should see:
nslookup www.theporadas.com
# Result:
www.theporadas.com canonical name = cname.vercel-dns.com
cname.vercel-dns.com has address = [Vercel IP]
```

### **Working Website:**

- `https://www.theporadas.com` → Your wedding website
- `https://theporadas.com` → Redirects to www version
- Green padlock (HTTPS) working

---

## 🚨 **Why This Happened**

**Possible causes:**

1. **DNS records not updated** - Still pointing to old hosting
2. **Wrong CNAME value** - Should be `cname.vercel-dns.com`
3. **Conflicting A records** - Old A records overriding CNAME
4. **Propagation delay** - Can take up to 48 hours (rare)

## 🔍 **Verify the Fix**
