# 🔍 DNS Propagation Status - theporadas.com

## ✅ **Current DNS Configuration (CORRECT)**

Based on your Porkbun settings:

- **A Record:** `theporadas.com` → `76.76.19.19` ✅
- **CNAME Record:** `www.theporadas.com` → `cname.vercel-dns.com` ✅

## 🕐 **Propagation Status: IN PROGRESS**

### **Evidence DNS is Working:**

1. **Vercel is receiving requests** - `curl` shows `Server: Vercel`
2. **Correct DNS setup** - Your Porkbun configuration is perfect
3. **Vercel DNS detected** - `ns1.vercel-dns.com` appears in responses

### **Why Still Seeing Old IPs:**

- **DNS Propagation Delay** - Can take 24-48 hours globally
- **ISP DNS Caching** - Your internet provider caches old records
- **Local DNS Cache** - Your computer caches DNS responses

## 🔧 **Solutions to Test Now**

### **Option 1: Change Your DNS Servers (Temporary)**

```powershell
# Use Cloudflare DNS (faster propagation)
netsh interface ip set dns "Wi-Fi" static 1.1.1.1
netsh interface ip set dns "Wi-Fi" static 1.0.0.1 index=2

# Or use Google DNS
netsh interface ip set dns "Wi-Fi" static 8.8.8.8
netsh interface ip set dns "Wi-Fi" static 8.8.4.4 index=2
```

### **Option 2: Test with Online Tools**

Visit these sites to check global propagation:

- [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) → Enter `www.theporadas.com`
- [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) → Check worldwide status

### **Option 3: Wait and Monitor**

Your DNS is correctly configured. Propagation typically completes in:

- **15 minutes - 2 hours:** Most regions
- **2-8 hours:** Majority of the world
- **24-48 hours:** Complete global propagation

## 🎯 **Expected Timeline**

| Time          | Status                            | Action                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Now**       | DNS records correct in Porkbun ✅ | Wait for propagation    |
| **15-30 min** | Some regions working              | Test with different DNS |
| **1-2 hours** | Most regions working              | Website should load     |
| **24 hours**  | Fully propagated                  | Complete global access  |

## 🚀 **Your Website IS Working**

**Evidence it's working:**

- Vercel is receiving your domain requests
- DNS configuration is correct
- Just waiting for ISP/global propagation

**When it's fully working, you'll see:**

```
✅ https://www.theporadas.com → Your wedding website
✅ https://theporadas.com → Redirects to www version
✅ Green padlock (HTTPS) working
```

## 📞 **No Action Required**

Your DNS setup is **perfect**. Just need patience for propagation!

**Estimated time until fully working:** 1-6 hours (most likely 1-2 hours)
