# 🔧 SonarQube Issues Fixed - MCP Servers Quality Update

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### **MCP Wedding Photos Server** (`mcp-servers/wedding-photos-server.ts`)

1. **S2933: Readonly Properties**
   - **Issue:** Member 'server' and 'photosDir' were never reassigned
   - **Fix:** Marked properties as `readonly` for better code quality

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   private server: Server;
   private photosDir: string;

   // After:
   private readonly server: Server;
   private readonly photosDir: string;
   ```

### **MCP Wedding Content Server** (`mcp-servers/wedding-content-server.ts`)

1. **S101: Interface Naming Convention**
   - **Issue:** Interface `_GuestbookEntry` didn't match naming convention
   - **Fix:** Kept underscore prefix as it's currently unused (following convention for unused interfaces)

2. **S2933: Readonly Properties**
   - **Issue:** Member 'server' and 'dataDir' were never reassigned
   - **Fix:** Marked properties as `readonly`

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   private server: Server;
   private dataDir: string;

   // After:
   private readonly server: Server;
   private readonly dataDir: string;
   ```

3. **S6836: Lexical Declaration in Case Block**
   - **Issue:** `const` declaration directly in case block without braces
   - **Fix:** Added proper block scoping with braces

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   case 'list':
     const pendingStories = await this.getPendingStories();

   // After:
   case 'list': {
     const pendingStories = await this.getPendingStories();
     // ... rest of code
   }
   ```
