# ✅ Project Organization Complete!

## 🎯 **What We Accomplished**

I've successfully organized your wedding website project into a clean, professional structure that follows modern software development best practices!

### **📁 Before: Cluttered Root Directory**

- 80+ files scattered in the root directory
- Documentation mixed with code and configuration
- Scripts, logs, and archives all together
- Difficult to navigate and maintain

### **📁 After: Clean, Professional Structure**

```
📁 docs/                   # All documentation organized by type
📁 scripts/               # Automation scripts by category
📁 logs/                  # Log files and reports
📁 archives/              # Archive and backup files
📄 Core project files     # Only essential files in root
```
