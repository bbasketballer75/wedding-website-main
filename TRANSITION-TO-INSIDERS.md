# 🚀 Transition to VS Code Insiders - Step by Step Guide

## Current Status

- ✅ VS Code Insiders installed via winget
- ✅ Current VS Code optimized with 39 extensions and superpower settings
- ✅ Analysis complete: Most settings remain valuable in Insiders

## 📋 TRANSITION STEPS

### Step 1: Launch VS Code Insiders

```powershell
# Find VS Code Insiders in Start Menu or
# Navigate to: C:\Users\Austin\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\Code - Insiders.exe
# Or use Windows key + type "VS Code Insiders"
```

### Step 2: Sign in and Sync Settings

1. **Open VS Code Insiders**
2. **Sign in with your GitHub/Microsoft account** (same account as current VS Code)
3. **Enable Settings Sync** (if prompted)
4. **Choose:** "Turn On Settings Sync"
5. **Select:** Extensions, Settings, Keybindings, UI State

This will automatically transfer:

- ✅ All 39 extensions
- ✅ All your superpower settings from .vscode/settings.json
- ✅ Workspace configuration
- ✅ Custom keybindings

### Step 3: Open Your Wedding Website Project

```powershell
# From Insiders, use:
# File → Open Folder → C:\Users\Austin\Downloads\wedding-website
```

### Step 4: Verify Configuration Transfer

Check these immediately:

#### ✅ Extensions Working:

- **TailwindCSS IntelliSense**: Type `className="bg-` in a .tsx file
- **Error Lens**: Should show custom pink/yellow backgrounds for errors
- **Copilot**: Should show suggestions with enhanced context

#### ✅ Agent Mode Available:

- **Open Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- **Search for:** "Copilot Edits"
- **Look for:** Agent mode dropdown in the sidebar

#### ✅ Workspace Settings:

- **Peacock**: Should show wedding colors in status bar
- **Todo Tree**: Should recognize WEDDING comments with heart icons
- **Custom dictionary**: Should not flag "Porada", "Jordyn", etc.

### Step 5: Test New Insiders Features

#### 🤖 Real Agent Mode:

1. **Open Copilot Edits** (sidebar)
2. **Select "Agent" from dropdown**
3. **Try:** "Add a new React component for wedding countdown"
4. **Compare** with previous Copilot experience

#### 🎯 Enhanced AI Features:

- **Multi-file editing**: Agent can edit multiple files simultaneously
- **Contextual understanding**: Better project-wide context
- **Proactive suggestions**: More intelligent refactoring suggestions

### Step 6: Validate All Project Tasks

Make sure these still work in Insiders:

```powershell
# Test development workflow:
npm run dev                    # Frontend dev server
cd backend && npm start       # Backend server
npm run test:frontend         # Vitest tests
npm run test:backend          # Jest tests
npm run build                 # Production build
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Extensions Don't Sync:

```powershell
# Manually install key extensions:
code-insiders --install-extension ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next
code-insiders --install-extension bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
code-insiders --install-extension GitHub.copilot
code-insiders --install-extension GitHub.copilot-chat
code-insiders --install-extension usernamehw.errorlens
```

### If Settings Don't Transfer:

1. **Copy settings manually**:
   - From: `C:\Users\Austin\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`
   - To: `C:\Users\Austin\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\User\settings.json`

2. **Copy workspace settings**:
   - Your `.vscode/settings.json` should work automatically

### If Tasks Don't Work:

- **All MCP servers**: Should auto-start (check terminal tabs)
- **Dev servers**: Should work identically
- **Build process**: Should be unchanged

## 🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS

### You'll know the transition worked when:

- ✅ **Agent Mode appears** in Copilot Edits sidebar
- ✅ **TailwindCSS suggestions** work perfectly
- ✅ **Error Lens shows custom styling** (pink errors, yellow warnings)
- ✅ **Wedding color theme** active in status bar
- ✅ **All 39 extensions** listed in Extensions view
- ✅ **MCP servers running** (multiple terminal tabs)
- ✅ **Both dev servers start** without issues

### You'll know you have "superpowers+" when:

- 🤖 **Agent Mode** can edit multiple files at once
- 🎯 **Enhanced context** understanding across your project
- 🚀 **Proactive suggestions** for wedding website improvements
- 💡 **Better code actions** for Next.js and React patterns

## 🔄 CONTINUE CONVERSATION

Once you're in VS Code Insiders with everything working:

1. **Open this file** (`TRANSITION-TO-INSIDERS.md`) in Insiders
2. **Verify Copilot Chat** is working
3. **Say:** "I'm now in VS Code Insiders, let's continue optimizing the wedding website"
