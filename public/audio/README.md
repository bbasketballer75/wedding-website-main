# Background Music Setup

## 📁 Audio File Location
Place your background music file in: `audio/` folder

## 🎵 Current Audio File
**File:** `Seven Lions, SLANDER, & Dabin feat. Dylan Matthew - First Time (Acoustic) ｜ Ophelia Records - SEVENLIONS.mp3`

## 🎵 Recommended Audio Settings
- **Format:** MP3 or OGG
- **Duration:** 3-5 minutes (it will loop automatically)
- **Volume:** Medium level (the website will adjust volume automatically)
- **Type:** Instrumental or soft background music that won't compete with the main video

## 🎛️ How It Works
- Music starts playing automatically after the intro video
- It lowers volume when the main wedding video plays
- Guests can control it with the floating player in the bottom-left corner
- It follows the page as guests scroll

## 📝 To Update Your Music:
1. Replace the current audio file with your preferred music
2. Update the file reference in the JavaScript if needed
3. Test the website to ensure it plays correctly

The music player will appear in the bottom-left corner and allows guests to pause/play and control volume!
