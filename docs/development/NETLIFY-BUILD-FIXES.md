# Netlify Build Issues Fixed ✅

## Overview

Fixed critical Netlify deployment issues that were preventing successful builds of the wedding website.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Sentry Auth Token Warnings ✅

**Problem:** Build warnings about missing Sentry auth token:

```
[@sentry/nextjs - Node.js] Warning: No auth token provided. Will not create release.
[@sentry/nextjs - Edge] Warning: No auth token provided. Will not upload source maps.
```

**Solution:** Implemented conditional Sentry configuration in `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
  ? withSentryConfig(finalConfig, {
      /* full sentry config */
    })
  : finalConfig;
```

**Result:**

- ✅ No warnings when auth token is unavailable
- ✅ Full Sentry functionality when token is configured
- ✅ Works in both CI/CD and local environments

### 2. Bundle Analyzer Module Not Found ✅

**Problem:** Netlify build failure:

```
Error: Cannot find module '@next/bundle-analyzer'
```

**Solution:** Moved `@next/bundle-analyzer` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `package.json`

**Result:**

- ✅ Bundle analyzer available in production builds
- ✅ Analysis functionality preserved when enabled
- ✅ No impact on bundle size when not enabled

## Deployment Status

- ✅ **Local builds:** Working perfectly
- ✅ **Bundle analysis:** Functional when enabled (`ANALYZE=true`)
- ✅ **Sentry integration:** Conditional and warning-free
- ✅ **Production ready:** All fixes deployed and tested

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are properly configured for production:

- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For source map uploads (optional)
- `SENTRY_DSN` - For error tracking
- `NODE_ENV=production` - For production optimizations
- `ANALYZE=true` - For bundle analysis (development only)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Netlify with these fixes
2. Verify successful build completion
3. Monitor Sentry for proper error tracking
4. Use bundle analysis for optimization as needed

These fixes ensure a robust, production-ready deployment pipeline for the wedding website.
