# MongoDB MCP Server Cleanup Complete ‚úÖ

## Issue Identified

You were correct! The MongoDB MCP server was still configured and running even though your wedding website project uses **Firebase/Firestore**, not MongoDB.

## What Was Removed

### 1. VS Code Task Configuration

**File:** `.vscode/tasks.json`

**Removed Task:**

```json
{
  "label": "Start MCP MongoDB Server",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["tsx", "C:/Users/Austin/Documents/GitHub/mongodb-mcp-server/src/index.ts"],
  "isBackground": true,
  "runOptions": { "runOn": "folderOpen" }
}
```

**Updated Compound Task:**
Removed `"Start MCP MongoDB Server"` from the `"Start All MCP Servers"` dependency list.

### 2. Running Processes

**Stopped MongoDB MCP server processes:**

- Process ID 30428 (node.exe running MongoDB MCP server)
- Process ID 34452 (node.exe running MongoDB MCP server)

## Current MCP Server Configuration

### ‚úÖ Active & Necessary MCP Servers:

1. **MCP Filesystem Server** - File system operations
2. **MCP Fetch Server** - Web requests and API calls
3. **MCP Time Server** - Date/time operations
4. **MCP Git Server** - Git repository operations
5. **MCP Playwright Server** - Browser automation and testing
6. **MCP Sequential Thinking Server** - AI reasoning workflows
7. **MCP Memory Server** - Knowledge graph and memory management

### ‚ùå Removed & Unnecessary:

- ~~MCP MongoDB Server~~ - **Not needed** (project uses Firebase/Firestore)

## Why MongoDB MCP Server Was Removed

### üéØ Project Database Stack:

- **Primary Database:** Google Firestore (NoSQL document store)
- **File Storage:** Google Cloud Storage
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth
- **Backend API:** Express.js with Firebase Admin SDK

### üö´ MongoDB Not Used:

- No MongoDB connection strings in environment variables
- No MongoDB schemas or models in codebase
- All data models use Firestore document structure
- Firebase CLI handles all database operations

## Verification

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Clean State:

1. **No MongoDB tasks** in `.vscode/tasks.json`
2. **No MongoDB processes** running
3. **All other MCP servers** still active and functional
4. **Project continues** to use Firebase/Firestore correctly

### üîÑ Auto-Start Prevention:

- MongoDB MCP server removed from `folderOpen` auto-start
- Will not restart when VS Code workspace reopens
- Compound task no longer includes MongoDB dependency

## Impact on Development

### ‚úÖ Positive Effects:

- **Faster startup** - One less server to launch
- **Cleaner process list** - No unnecessary MongoDB processes
- **Reduced memory usage** - MongoDB MCP server no longer consuming resources
- **Focused environment** - Only tools relevant to Firebase development

### ‚úÖ No Negative Effects:

- **All project functionality preserved** - Firebase/Firestore operations unaffected
- **All other MCP servers active** - Full development capabilities maintained
- **Database operations continue normally** - Firestore integration unchanged

## Future Considerations

### üö® If MongoDB Ever Needed:

The task configuration is preserved in this document and can be restored if:

- Project requirements change to include MongoDB
- Multi-database architecture is implemented
- MongoDB becomes necessary for specific features

### üéØ Current Recommendation:

**Keep current configuration** - Firebase/Firestore provides all database functionality needed for the wedding website project.
