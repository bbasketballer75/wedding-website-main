## 🛠️ Management Commands

### NPM Scripts (Recommended)

```bash
# Check status of all MCP servers
npm run mcp:status

# Start sequential thinking server
npm run mcp:sequential

# Start full development environment (includes sequential thinking)
npm run dev:full
```

### PowerShell Scripts (Windows)

```powershell
# Start server (auto-detects if already running)
scripts\start-sequential-thinking.ps1

# Check server status
scripts\start-sequential-thinking.ps1 -Status

# Force restart server
scripts\start-sequential-thinking.ps1 -Force

# Stop server
scripts\start-sequential-thinking.ps1 -Stop

# Quiet mode (minimal output)
scripts\start-sequential-thinking.ps1 -Quiet
```

### VS Code Tasks

1. **Ctrl+Shift+P** → "Tasks: Run Task"
2. Choose from:
   - `Manage Sequential Thinking Server` - Start/manage server
   - `Sequential Thinking Server - Status` - Check status
   - `Start MCP Sequential Thinking Server` - Direct start (background)

## 🔧 Features

### Auto-Management

- **Auto-build**: Rebuilds server if source files are missing
- **Auto-restart**: Automatically restarts on failures (max 5 attempts)
- **Health monitoring**: Continuous status monitoring
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup on termination

### Logging

- **Structured logging**: Timestamped entries with log levels
- **File logging**: Logs saved to `logs/sequential-thinking.log`
- **Console output**: Color-coded status messages
- **Error tracking**: Detailed error reporting and restart attempts

### Integration

- **VS Code tasks**: Integrated into development workflow
- **NPM scripts**: Part of package.json development commands
- **Development environment**: Auto-starts with `npm run dev:full`

## 📊 Server Information

- **Server Path**: `C:\Users\Austin\Documents\GitHub\servers\src\sequentialthinking\dist\index.js`
- **Process Name**: `node.exe`
- **Communication**: STDIO (Model Context Protocol)
- **Auto-restart**: Enabled (max 5 attempts)
- **Memory Usage**: ~55MB typical

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

1. Check if source files exist: `ls C:\Users\Austin\Documents\GitHub\servers\src\sequentialthinking\dist\index.js`
2. Rebuild if needed: `cd C:\Users\Austin\Documents\GitHub\servers\src\sequentialthinking && npm run build`
3. Check logs: `cat logs\sequential-thinking.log`

### Server Keeps Restarting

1. Check logs for error patterns
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Ensure no port conflicts (though this server uses STDIO)

### VS Code Integration Issues

1. Reload VS Code workspace
2. Check tasks.json syntax
3. Verify PowerShell execution policy: `Get-ExecutionPolicy`

## 📝 Logs Location

All server activity is logged to:

```
C:\Users\Austin\Downloads\wedding-website\logs\sequential-thinking.log
```

Example log entries:

```

[2025-08-05 09:23:31] [SUCCESS] MCP Sequential Thinking Server is running successfully
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

The Sequential Thinking MCP Server is now fully operational and integrated into your development workflow. It will:

1. **Auto-start** when you run `npm run dev:full`
2. **Auto-restart** if it crashes (up to 5 times)
3. **Log all activity** to help with debugging
4. **Integrate with VS Code** through tasks and commands

The server is ready to provide advanced reasoning capabilities for your wedding website development! 🎉
