TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
Site won't build:
- Check build logs in Netlify
- Verify environment variables
- Test build locally first

Images not loading:
- Check file paths are correct
- Verify images are in public/ folder
- Test with different image formats

Forms not working:
- Check API endpoints
- Verify CORS settings
- Test network requests

Performance issues:
- Run bundle analyzer
- Optimize images further
- Check third-party scripts
